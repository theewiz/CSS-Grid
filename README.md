# CSS-Grid
This project helped me understand CSS Grids in-depth, and how to structure content
This is a solution to the [Testimonials grid section challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7).

## Overview

  This was a practice project to improve my knowledge of CSS Grids, and also get to practice developing for various screen sizes - Desktop and Mobile. It involved creating a responsive testimonial page.

### The challenge

   The challenge was from [Frontend-Mentor] and it involved ensuring the creation of a responsive testimonial page.
   
   From the challenge, Users should be able to:
   - View the optimal layout for the testimonial site depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

    Some of the tools used during the creation of this project includes:
- HTML5 markup
- Very little Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Truly I am impressed by the project, and how I was able to pull it off. For someone coming from a Product Design background I am truly happy. I tried working on the project using the:

```css
.testimonials {
    grid-template-areas:
    '...';
}
```
but quickly, I realised that it'll compound the entire thing.
Asides this, the entire build was interesting to go through.

### Continued development

Looking forward, I'd be taking more practical projects to really develop my knowledge of CSS Grids
